<p>Remember, you will not be able to see all of the other players. The game is not over and you should keep playing as long as you see the following message:</p>
<p class="conflicts" style="text-align: center;">Some players still have color conflicts...</p>
<p>When all color conflicts have been solved, the message will change to this:</p>
<p class="no-conflicts" style="text-align: center;">All color conflicts are solved!</p>
<p>After that, the game will end.</p>
