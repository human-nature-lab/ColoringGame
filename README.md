## [Coloring Game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_coloring_game)
In this game players are given the collaborative task of choosing colors such that each player's color is distinct from each of their neighbors.

This is an example of an asynchronous game: each player may make choices at any time during the game without waiting for other players.
