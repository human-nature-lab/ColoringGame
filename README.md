## [Coloring Game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_coloring_game)
In this game players are given the collaborative task of choosing colors such that each player's color is distinct from each of their neighbors.

This is an *asynchronous* game and, as such, is very different from the other examples. This experiment uses an updated client timer. In order for the client's timer to work, you will have to copy and paste the code from client-graph.js into the Client Graph dialog and copy and paste the code from client.html into the Client HTML dialog.
